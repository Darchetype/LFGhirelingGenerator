# LFGhirelingGenerator
A hireling generator for Low Fantasy Gaming, an amazing tabletop RPG!

This script is written in Python 3 and requires tkinter. If you have both installed just run gui.py to launch the program! 

There's also a stand-alone executable version of the program, which is zipped inside the gui folder. To run that, just unzip the folder and run gui.exe
